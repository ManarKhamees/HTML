  <h2><u>What is  the introducation of math</u></h2>
  <p><strong>Mathematics</strong> <mark>plays a crucial role in numerous disciplines</mark>. It encompasses various areas including algebra, geometry, calculus, and statistics. These mathematical concepts are fundamental to solving problems and making informed decisions in fields like technology, architecture, and physics. We live in a <em>world shaped by mathematics</em>.</p>
  <p>Understanding <mark>mathematical principles</mark> and <strong>theories</strong> is essential for tackling complex problems and innovations. <del>Without a solid grasp of these concepts</del>, advancements in science and technology would be significantly hindered. <u>Mathematics</u> helps us analyze data, model real-world phenomena, and make precise predictions.</p>

  <h3>Introduction to Chemistry</h3>
  <p><mark>Chemistry</mark>, the science that explores the properties, <u>composition, and structure of substances (elements and compounds), the transformations they undergo, and the energy that is released</u> or absorbed during these processes. <strong>Every material,</strong> whether naturally occurring or synthetically created, <mark><u>consists of one or more of the various elements</u></mark> identified in the periodic table. Although these elements are composed of even smaller particles, they represent the fundamental building blocks of chemical substances. There is no quantity of <del>hydrogen, carbon, or nitrogen</del> smaller than an atom of that substance. Chemistry, therefore, focuses not on subatomic particles but on the properties of atoms, their combinations, and how understanding these properties can be utilized for specific applications.</p>
